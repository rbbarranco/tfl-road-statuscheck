# TFL Road Status Checker
This is an implementation of TFL's Developer Coding Challenge

### Some notes on the challenge requirements
* Saw in this [post](https://techforum.tfl.gov.uk/t/not-able-to-find-app-id-and-key/1883/2) that the App_Id is no longer needed. My testing also shows that it is no longer required. But I kept it in the config file and I still append it in the requests done to the Road endpoint.
